# Deep-learning---homework1
Three machine learning methods including linear regression, decision tree, and support vector machine were used to 
distinguish the numbers. SVM perfoms the best with an accuracy of 97.92%. This accuracy is similar to or even a little bit 
better than that of the neural network example. Linear regression, however, cannot predict the numbers accurately with a
correlation coefficient of 0.624. Decisiosn tree has an accuray of 0.877.
